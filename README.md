# flutter_meteor

Connect flutter apps to meteor data

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

## Start the meteor server
I included a meteor example to start it run the following
`cd example && meteor`
